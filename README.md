salesforcesearchbox
===================


A simple search box on top of all configuration items of salesforce setup items.
Enough time is wasted on finding the class and label by creating views or searching for the same type of fields within an object .

Tired of pressing more link every time ?

I have a solution , try this google chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-search-box/moaokcjghnjifeeahifofckbmhofjdbi?hl=en) , it brings in a simple search box, which will search in all configuration items on the page.
takes care of pressing the more link.

The plugin supports some basic regex searches 
ex: OR search - formula|lookup

```
AND search - 
^(?=.*\text1\b)(?=.*\text2\b)
```

Don't forget to press "Enter" to search and "Esc" to cancel.
